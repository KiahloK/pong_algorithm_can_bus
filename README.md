# Pong Algorithm with CAN Bus 

## Description

We created an game algorithm for a simulated Pong Game on a automotive
software. The software has to be installed onto a Featherboard M4 can with a 10x10 RGB click 
to display the scoreboard and then connected to a server via CAN Bus
that hosts the game. 

This software was created at a student Hackathon on 16th and 17th of May 2024 at Vector Informatik.
